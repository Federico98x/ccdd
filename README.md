# An Asynchronous Omegle Bot

Python API for Omegle. Compatible with Python 3.

Discord Support: https://discord.gg/kaX9H65VhG

Note: This project used to be based off of elias94's pyomegle, however I have since rewritten it from scratch. As such, the previous licensing does not apply and has been removed.

# Are you looking to run more than one?

If you want to run more than 1 of this Bot at the same time and not get blocked by Omegle, I have
a private project with the ability to scale this up through a combination of proxies and (other)
private methods not included in this library. 

This is not public whatsoever and access to the repository
with the code can be purchased. This purchase includes *all* future changes to the code, so that you never
have to worry about updating it yourself.

Join the support discord and DM fallen#9745 for inquiries into this.
