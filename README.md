# An Asynchronous Omegle Bot

Python API for Omegle. Compatible with Python 3.

Discord Support: https://discord.gg/kaX9H65VhG

Note: This project used to be based off of elias94's pyomegle, however I have since rewritten it from scratch. As such, the previous licensing does not apply and has been removed.

# Are you looking to run more than one?

I have a private project that scales this up (and is maintained) for multiple instances.
This means you can run 5, 10, 15, 20 instances of the Bot with no issue. This is not 
public and access to the repository (and all future updates) can be purchased.
Join the support discord and DM fallen#9745 for inquiries into this.
